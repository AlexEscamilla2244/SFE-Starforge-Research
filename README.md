## Overview
This repository contains the core of my undergraduate research, developed at SDSU and the Carnegie Astrophysics Summer Student Internship (CASSI) with Dr. Mike Grudić and Dr. Anna Rosen.  
The project investigates **star formation efficiency (SFE)** through **synthetic far-infrared observations** of **STARFORGE** simulations, replicating data from *Spitzer* and *Herschel*.  
Our analysis reproduces the **low star formation efficiencies observed in molecular clouds**, bridging the gap between simulations and observations.

## Research Focus
- Generate mock far-IR observations from STARFORGE radiation-MHD simulations  
- Measure SFE using observational techniques  
- Examine how resolution and contamination affect inferred efficiencies  
- Discuss implications for interpreting observed star formation and depletion rates  

---

## Key Results
- Synthetic observations reproduce observed low SFE values, showing that observational biases can reconcile theory and observation  
- Provides a framework for connecting simulation-based and observation-based measures of SFE
